I'll help you understand the `np.concatenate(data_list, axis=-1)` line with a concrete example. Let's break this down step by step.

Let's simulate a simplified version of your code that follows the same pattern:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Let's create a small example with:
# - 3 timesteps
# - 2 nodes
# - 2 features (like your pick and drop)

# 1. First, let's create a simple DataFrame (this would be your df)
df = np.array([
    [[1, 2],  # timestep 1, features for node 1 and 2
     [3, 4]], # timestep 2, features for node 1 and 2
    [[5, 6],  # timestep 3, features for node 1 and 2
     [7, 8]]
])

# Shape is (2, 2, 2) - (timesteps, nodes, features)
print("Original data shape:", df.shape)
print("Original data:\n", df)

# Create data_list starting with df
data_list = [df]

# Let's add time_in_day (simplified for example)
time_in_day = np.array([
    [[0.25, 0.25],    # 6:00 AM (0.25 of a day)
     [0.50, 0.50]],   # 12:00 PM (0.50 of a day)
    [[0.75, 0.75],    # 6:00 PM (0.75 of a day)
     [1.00, 1.00]]    # 12:00 AM (1.00 of a day)
])
data_list.append(time_in_day)

print("\nData list contents:")
print("First array (df):\n", data_list[0])
print("\nSecond array (time_in_day):\n", data_list[1])

# Now let's concatenate along the last axis (-1)
result = np.concatenate(data_list, axis=-1)
print("\nFinal concatenated shape:", result.shape)
print("Final concatenated data:\n", result)
```

When you run this code, you'll get output like this:

```
Original data shape: (2, 2, 2)
Original data:
 [[[1 2]
  [3 4]]
 [[5 6]
  [7 8]]]

Data list contents:
First array (df):
 [[[1 2]
  [3 4]]
 [[5 6]
  [7 8]]]

Second array (time_in_day):
 [[[0.25 0.25]
  [0.5  0.5 ]]
 [[0.75 0.75]
  [1.   1.  ]]]

Final concatenated shape: (2, 2, 4)
Final concatenated data:
 [[[1.   2.   0.25 0.25]
  [3.   4.   0.5  0.5 ]]
 [[5.   6.   0.75 0.75]
  [7.   8.   1.   1.  ]]]
```

Let's explain what happened:

1. Initially, we had two 3D arrays in `data_list`:
   - First array (your traffic data): shape (2, 2, 2)
   - Second array (time_in_day): shape (2, 2, 2)

2. When we concatenate with `axis=-1` (or `axis=2` in this case), numpy combines the arrays along the last dimension. This means:
   - For each timestep and node, it joins the features together
   - The original 2 features (pick/drop) and the 2 time features are combined into 4 features
   - The result has shape (2, 2, 4)

In your actual code:
```python
data = np.concatenate(data_list, axis=-1)  # (4368, 250, 2) add false
```
This is doing the same thing but with:
- 4368 timesteps instead of 2
- 250 nodes instead of 2
- When `add_time_in_day=False` and `add_day_in_week=False`, you only have the original features, so the final dimension stays 2

If you had set `add_time_in_day=True`, it would add one more feature (making it 3), and if you had also set `add_day_in_week=True`, it would add 7 more features (making it 10 total).

The key thing to remember is that `axis=-1` means "concatenate along the last dimension", which in this case means joining the features together while keeping the time steps and nodes structure intact.
